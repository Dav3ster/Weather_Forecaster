# Weather_Forecaster

## Purpose of this challenge

The reason for this challenge was to become more familiar with using server side API's. Also we learned how to use parameters to get more specific data, and in so we got more experience reading, and working with API documentaion. In addtion to working with just normal api calls, I learned how to pass data from one call to another to make more detailed data requests.
